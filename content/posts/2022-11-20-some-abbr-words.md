title: 常用开发术语简写
---


-   **PR:** Pull Request. 拉取请求，给其他项目提交代码
-   **LGTM:** Looks Good To Me. ~~朕知道了~~，代码已经过 review，可以合并
-   **SGTM:** Sounds Good To Me. 和上面那句意思差不多，也是已经通过了 review 的意思
-   **WIP:** Work In Progress. 传说中提 PR 的最佳实践是，如果你有个改动很大的 PR，可以在写了一部分的情况下先提交，但是在标题里写上 WIP，以告诉项目维护者这个功能还未完成，方便维护者提前 review 部分提交的代码。
-   **PTAL:** Please Take A Look. 你来瞅瞅？用来提示别人来看一下
-   **TBR:** To Be Reviewed. 提示维护者进行 review
-   **TL;DR:** Too Long; Didn't Read. 太长懒得看。也有很多文档在做简略描述之前会写这么一句
-   **TBD:** To Be Done (or Defined/Discussed/Decided/Determined). 根据语境不同意义有所区别，但一般都是还没搞定的意思
